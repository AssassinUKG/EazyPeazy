# Script for room in Looking Glass

![Script Logo](https://github.com/H0j3n/EazyPeazy/blob/master/TryHackMe/Looking%20Glass/img/logo.PNG)

I love to make my own things and maybe there are much more better script than mine. But I will update my tools along with my journey.

The reason I make this script because I want to make it more easier for me to get the port in this room. Hope this could help anyone on their journey of learning.

Enjoy!

# How To Use ?

```
./script.sh 10.10.10.10
```
