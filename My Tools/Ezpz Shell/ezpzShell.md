I love to make my own things and maybe there are much more better script than mine. But I will update my tools along with my journey. Every new wordlist or new parameters that I found will update in here :)

The reason I make this script because I want to make it more easier for me to get the reverse shell command instead of view my notes so its like changing my notes to much more cool style haha. Hope this could help anyone on their journey of learning.

Enjoy!
